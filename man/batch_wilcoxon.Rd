\title{Batch Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test Between Two Groups}
\usage{
batch_wilcoxon(
  data,
  target = "group",
  feature = NULL,
  feature_manipulation = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame. Input data for analysis.}

\item{target}{Character. Name of the column representing group labels. Default is "group".}

\item{feature}{Character vector or NULL. Names of features to analyze. If NULL, all continuous features are used. Default is NULL.}

\item{feature_manipulation}{Logical. Whether to apply custom feature manipulation. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
Data frame with statistical results for each feature (p-value, adjusted p-value, log p-value, significance stars).
}
\description{
Performs Wilcoxon rank-sum tests on a dataset to compare the distribution of specified features between two groups. Computes p-values, adjusts for multiple testing, and ranks features by significance. Returns a data frame with feature names, p-values, adjusted p-values, log-transformed p-values, and significance stars.

\examples{
# Load TCGA-STAD microenvironment signature data
data("sig_stad", package = "IOBR")
# Find microenvironmental scores associated with Gender
batch_wilcoxon(data = sig_stad, target = "Gender", feature = colnames(sig_stad)[69:ncol(sig_stad)])
