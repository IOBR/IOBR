\title{Generate Reference Signature Matrix Using Limma}
\usage{
generateRef_limma(dat, pheno, FDR = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{data frame or matrix; gene probes in the row and samples in the column}

\item{pheno}{character vector; cell type class of the samples}

\item{FDR}{numeric; genes with BH adjust p value < FDR are considered significant.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
        - `reference_matrix`: A dataframe of median expression values for significantly expressed genes, with genes as rows.
        - `G`: The number of probes used in the reference matrix that resulted in the lowest condition number.
        - `condition_number`: The minimum condition number obtained from the analysis.
        - `whole_matrix`: A matrix of median values across all samples and conditions for further analysis.
}
\description{
This function performs differential expression analysis using the limma package to identify significantly
expressed genes across different cell types specified in `pheno`. It computes median expression levels
of these significant genes to create a reference signature matrix. The function is particularly useful
for constructing signature matrices in gene expression studies involving multiple cell types or conditions.
