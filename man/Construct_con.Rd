\title{Construct Contrast Matrix}
\usage{
Construct_con(pheno, mode)
}
\arguments{
\item{pheno}{A factor variable with different levels representing groups or conditions to contrast.}

\item{mode}{Currently unused but reserved for future extensions where different modes of contrast might be implemented.}
}
\value{
A square matrix with dimensions equal to the number of levels in `pheno`.
        Each row represents a contrast where the corresponding level is compared against the average of others.
        The matrix elements are set to -1 for non-diagonal cells (indicating comparison groups)
        and 1 for diagonal cells (indicating the group of interest).
}
\description{
This function creates a contrast matrix for differential analysis, where each phenotype level is contrasted
against all other levels combined. This is particularly useful in linear models for comparing multiple groups.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
pheno <- factor(c("A", "B", "C", "D"))
contrast_matrix <- Construct_con(pheno, mode = NULL)
print(contrast_matrix)
}
