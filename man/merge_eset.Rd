\title{Merge expression sets by row names}
\usage{
merge_eset(eset1, eset2, eset3 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{eset1}{The first expression set to be merged.}

\item{eset2}{The second expression set to be merged.}

\item{eset3}{The optional third expression set to be merged; default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A merged expression set from the input expression sets, with duplicate gene symbols removed.
}
\description{
This function merges two or three expression sets by their row names, ensuring that 
no duplicated gene symbols remain after the merge. It is particularly useful in 
bioinformatics workflows where combining multiple datasets into a single expression 
set is required for downstream analysis.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `eset1`, `eset2`, and `eset3` are available in the environment
# All three expression sets must have the same row names (gene symbols)
merged_eset <- merge_eset(eset1, eset2, eset3)
