\title{CIBERSORT is an analytical tool developed by Newman et al. to provide an estimation of the abundances of member cell types in a mixed cell population, using gene expression data.}
\usage{
CIBERSORT(
  sig_matrix = lm22,
  mixture_file,
  perm,
  QN = TRUE,
  absolute,
  abs_method = "sig.score"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sig_matrix}{Cell type GEP barcode matrix: row 1 = sample labels; column 1 = gene symbols; no missing values; default =LM22.txt download from CIBERSORT (https://cibersort.stanford.edu/runcibersort.php)}

\item{mixture_file}{GEP matrix: row 1 = sample labels; column 1 = gene symbols; no missing values}

\item{perm}{Set permutations for statistical analysis (â‰¥100 permutations recommended).}

\item{QN}{Quantile normalization of input mixture (default = TRUE)}

\item{absolute}{Run CIBERSORT in absolute mode (default = FALSE)
- note that cell subsets will be scaled by their absolute levels and will not be represented as fractions
(to derive the default output, normalize absolute levels such that they sum to 1 for each mixture sample)
- the sum of all cell subsets in each mixture sample will be added to the ouput ('Absolute score').
If LM22 is used, this score will capture total immune content.}

\item{abs_method}{if absolute is set to TRUE, choose method: 'no.sumto1' or 'sig.score'
- sig.score = for each mixture sample, define S as the median expression
level of all genes in the signature matrix divided by the median expression
level of all genes in the mixture. Multiple cell subset fractions by S.
- no.sumto1 = remove sum to 1 constraint}
}
\value{
A matrix object containing the estimated cibersort-cell fractions, p-values, correlation coefficients, and RMSE values.
