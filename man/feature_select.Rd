\title{Feature Selection}
\usage{
feature_select(
  x,
  y,
  method = c("cor", "dif"),
  family = c("spearman", "pearson"),
  cutoff = NULL,
  padjcut = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix with rownames representing features like gene symbols or cgi, and colnames as samples.}

\item{y}{A response variable vector that can be quantitative, binary, or survival type.}

\item{method}{Specifies the method for feature selection; "cor" for correlation or "dif" for differential expression.}

\item{family}{Specifies the correlation method to use if method="cor"; options are "spearman" or "pearson".}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric value for estimating and log2 fold change cutoff for correlation analysis and limma differential analysis.}

\item{padjcut}{Numeric value for adjusted P-value cutoff.}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of selected feature names based on the specified criteria.
}
\description{
This function selects features based on either correlation or differential expression analysis.
It uses the 'limma' package for differential expression and basic statistical tests for correlation analysis.
