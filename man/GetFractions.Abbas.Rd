\title{Constrained regression method implemented in Abbas et al., 2009}
\usage{
GetFractions.Abbas(XX, YY, w = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{XX}{Matrix representing immune expression data with genes as rows and cell types as columns.}

\item{YY}{Vector representing cancer expression data with gene expression levels.}

\item{w}{Optional vector of weights for the regression, default is NA which means no weights are applied.}
}
\value{
A vector with non-negative coefficients representing the proportions of each cell type in the input expression data.
}
\description{
This function implements a constrained regression approach described by Abbas et al. in their 2009 paper.
It is designed to estimate the proportions of immune cell types within a mixed cancer tissue sample
based on gene expression data. The method iteratively adjusts the regression coefficients to ensure
they are non-negative, which corresponds to realistic proportions of cell types.
}
\examples{
# Generate some example data
XX <- matrix(runif(100), nrow=10, ncol=10)
colnames(XX) <- paste("CellType", 1:10, sep="")
YY <- runif(10)

# Apply the Abbas constrained regression method
results <- GetFractions.Abbas(XX, YY)
print(results)
