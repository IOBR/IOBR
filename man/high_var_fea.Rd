\title{Identify High-Variance Features from Statistical Results}
\usage{
high_var_fea(
  result,
  target,
  name_padj = "padj",
  padj_cutoff = 1,
  name_logfc,
  logfc_cutoff = 0,
  n = 10,
  data_type = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{Data frame or tibble. Statistical results containing feature, adjusted p-value, and logFC columns.}

\item{target}{Character. Column name of feature identifiers.}

\item{name_padj}{Character. Adjusted p-value column name. Default "padj".}

\item{padj_cutoff}{Numeric. Adjusted p-value threshold. Default 1.}

\item{name_logfc}{Character. log2 fold-change column name.}

\item{logfc_cutoff}{Numeric. Absolute log2 fold-change threshold. Default 0.}

\item{n}{Integer. Number of top up and top down features to select. Default 10.}

\item{data_type}{Character or NULL. If "survival", adjusts logFC interpretation.}
}
\value{
Character vector of selected feature names (combined up and down sets).
}
\description{
Selects top variable (up- and down-regulated) features based on adjusted p-value and log fold-change thresholds.

\examples{
result_data <- data.frame(gene = c("Gene1","Gene2","Gene3"), padj = c(0.01,0.2,0.05), logfc = c(-2,1.5,-3))
