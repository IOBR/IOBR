\title{Feature Selection for Predictive or Prognostic Models Using LASSO Regression}
\usage{
lasso_select(
  x,
  y,
  type = c("binary", "survival"),
  nfold = 10,
  lambda = c("lambda.min", "lambda.1se")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix. Features (e.g., gene symbols or CGI) as row names and samples as column names.}

\item{y}{A response variable vector. Can be binary (0/1) or survival data (e.g., survival time and event status).}

\item{type}{Character. Model type: "binary" for binary response or "survival" for survival analysis. Default is "binary".}

\item{nfold}{Integer. Number of folds for cross-validation. Default is 10.}

\item{lambda}{Character. Regularization parameter selection: "lambda.min" (minimum mean cross-validated error) or "lambda.1se" (one standard error from minimum). Default is "lambda.min".}
}
\value{
Character vector of selected feature names with non-zero coefficients in the optimal LASSO model.
}
\description{
Applies LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression to construct predictive or prognostic models. Supports both binary and survival response variables, utilizing cross-validation for optimal model selection.

\examples{
data("gene_expression", package = "examplePackage")
survival_data <- survival::Surv(time = c(2, 4, 3), event = c(1, 0, 1))
# Binary response example
binary_outcome <- c(0, 1, 1)
lasso_select(x = gene_expression, y = binary_outcome, type = "binary")
# Survival response example
lasso_select(x = gene_expression, y = survival_data, type = "survival")
