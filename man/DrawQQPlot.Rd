\title{Draw QQ Plot Comparing Cancer and Immune Expression}
\usage{
DrawQQPlot(cancer.exp, immune.exp, name = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{cancer.exp}{A vector of gene expression data for cancer samples.}

\item{immune.exp}{A vector of gene expression data for immune samples.}

\item{name}{Optional parameter to add a subtitle with additional information.}
}
\value{
Generates a QQ plot.
}
\description{
This function creates a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot to compare the gene expression
distributions between cancer and immune samples. The QQ plot helps assess if the
two distributions are similarly shaped by plotting their quantiles against each other.
Points lining up along the diagonal line indicate similar distributions.
The function also fits a linear model to the central portion of the data (excluding
the lowest 40% and the highest 10% of data points) to highlight the trend.
