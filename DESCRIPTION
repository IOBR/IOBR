Description: This package offers six modules for TME analysis based on
    multi-omics data. These modules cover data preprocessing, TME
    estimation, TME infiltrating patterns, cellular interactions, genome
    and TME interaction, and visualization for TME relevant features, as
    well as modelling based on key features. It integrates multiple vital
    microenvironmental analysis algorithms and signature estimation
    methods, simplifying the analysis and downstream visualization of the
    TME. In addition to providing a quick and easy way to construct gene
    signatures from scRNA-seq data, It also provides a way to construct a
    reference matrix for TME deconvolution from scRNA-seq data. The
    analysis pipeline and feature visualization are user-friendly and
    provide a comprehensive description of the complex TME, offering
    insights into tumour-immune interactions.
